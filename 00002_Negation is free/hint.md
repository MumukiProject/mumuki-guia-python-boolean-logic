Both `is_adult` and `is_minor` take an `age` as argument - those who are 18 years or older are adults. ğŸ‘¶ The rest are minors. 

You don't have to define them all at once - you can solve this exercise _iteratively_ :wink::

  1. First, define, test in the console and submit `is_adult`. 
  2. When ready, do the same with `is_minor`.
