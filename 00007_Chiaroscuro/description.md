Umi is designing a web page and is focusing on the contrast of its components. :star_struck:

To achieve this, Umi defined the function `is_light_tone` that takes a color as a parameter and returns if it is light:

```python
ムis_light_tone('red')
False

ムis_light_tone('white')
True
```

> :art: Now it's your turn! Define the function `has_contrast` which takes as arguments the _font color_ and the _background color_ of the page and returns whether the page color palette has contrast. 
> 
> 🆚 For the page to have contrast, it must have a light _background_ and dark _font_, or have a light _font_ and a dark _background_. :relieved:
