Umi is designing a web page and is focusing on the contrast of its components. :star_struck:

To achieve this, Umi asked us to define the function `has_contrast` which takes as arguments the font color and the background color of the page and returns whether the page has contrast.

We have already defined the function `is_light_tone` that takes a color as a parameter and returns if it is light:

```python
ムis_light_tone('red')
False

ムis_light_tone('white')
True
```

> Now it's your turn! Define the function `has_contrast`. For the page to have contrast, it must have a light background and dark font, or have a light font and a dark background.:relieved:
