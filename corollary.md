Congratulations! :clap:

In this lesson, you learned about three types of logical operators: the conjunction `&&`, which is true if all of its statements are true; the disjunction `||`, which is true if one of its statements is true; and `xor`, which is true if only one of its statements is true.

You also learned that these operators have precedence and how we can adjust that precedence to suit our needs using parentheses. :grin:
